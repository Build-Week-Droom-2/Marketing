            <p> <em>We connect employers with potential employees more efficiently, and more effectively. </em> <br><br>
                Droom connects you, the potential new hire, with job postings near you. We allow you to passively work on your job search. It’s simple: You create an account, you swipe left for jobs you aren’t interested in, and swipe right for those you are interested in. If the recruiter who posted the job thinks you’re a good fit, they’ll swipe right, and you will match. Now, you’re free to chat!

        <div class = "middle">
                <p><em>You Swipe. You Match. You Get Hired. </em><br><br>
                    Matching with a job posting gives you full access to a recruiter, and to their hiring process for that particular job. Unlike traditional job application channels, you KNOW when a company is truly interested in you for a position - once you match, you can begin the hiring process.
